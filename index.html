        <td bgcolor="pink">Cristiano Ronaldo 910th Career Goal, Portugal vs Poland: Cristiano Ronaldo rolled back years as he unleashed a memorable moment during Portugal's Nations League match against Poland on Friday.

            Ronaldo scored an incredible goal through a jaw-dropping overhead kick to help Portugal beat Poland 5-0 at the Estadio Do Dragao in Porto.
            
            After a goalless first half, Rafael Leao broke the deadlock just before the hour with a header. Ronaldo then doubled the lead from the penalty spot in the 72nd minute.
            
            While Bruno Fernandes smashed in the third, Ronaldo set up a decisive pass for Pedro Neto to score within the inside post.
            
            The memorable instance came when Ronaldo made the most of a dipping cross from Vitinha before beating goalkeeper Marcin Bulka with a close-range overhead kick.</td>

    <td bgcolor="pink">A hacker has been sentenced to five years in a US prison for laundering the proceeds of one of the biggest ever cryptocurrency thefts.

        Ilya Lichtenstein pleaded guilty last year in the case involving the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange being hacked in 2016 and the theft of almost 120,000 bitcoin.
        
        He laundered the stolen cryptocurrency with the help of his wife Heather Morgan, who used the alias Razzlekhan to promote her hip hop music.
        
        At the time of the theft, the bitcoin was worth around $70m (Â£55.3m), but had risen in value to more than $4.5bn by the time they were arrested. At today's prices they would be worth more than double that.</td>
